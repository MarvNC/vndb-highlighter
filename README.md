# vndb-list-info

A userscript to add personalised info to staff and producers on vndb.

## Highlighting

This userscript will work on staff and company pages to highlight entries that are on your VNDB list.

## Tooltips

In addition, the userscript will add tooltips to staff and producer links so you can easily see what novels and roles you know a producer or staff for.

## Usage

You can navigate to your user settings page to change the colors that the userscript uses to highlight entries.

Note that the userscript currently has a limit of ten minutes between fetching the user list again, and a limit of one hour before fetching tooltips again. You can force an update of a tooltip by visiting the staff or producer page.
